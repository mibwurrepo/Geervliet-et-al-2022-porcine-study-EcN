***General Introduction***
This README file corresponds to the data corresponding to Figure S8 of the manuscript.
This dataset contains data collected during an in vivo experiment with pigs at the Wageningen University as part of the PhD Thesis Projects of Mirelle Geervliet and Hugo de Vries (first authors of the manuscript). 
This research project was made possible by The Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research and Vereniging Diervoeders Nederland (VDN).

***Purpose of the analysis***
To study the effect of EcN on body weight over time. 

***Methodological information***
Body weight was measured on different time points of the study (pre- and post-weaning).  

***Data specific information***
