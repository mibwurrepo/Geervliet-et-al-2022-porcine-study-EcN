***General Introduction***
This README file corresponds to the data corresponding to Figure 5 of the manuscript.
This dataset contains data collected during an in vivo experiment with pigs at the Wageningen University as part of the PhD Thesis Projects of Mirelle Geervliet and Hugo de Vries (first authors of the manuscript). 
This research project was made possible by The Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research and Vereniging Diervoeders Nederland (VDN).

***Purpose of analysis***
To assess differences in gene expression of mucosal scrapings of different gut segments between the treatment groups.

***Methodological information***
For a detailed description of how Fluidigm data was generated, please see the Materials & Methods section of the manuscript.

***Data specific information***
In the Figure 5 folder, two subfoldors can be found, namely:

1. Unprocessed_Figure:
This folder contains a PDF file with the figures as generated by R. 
This PDF file was used to create final Figure 5. 

2. Final_Figure:
This folder contains the final figure as presented in the manuscript. 
The final figure is prepared in Adoble Illustrator. 

Raw_data:
Fluidigm datafiles can be found in the folder named "Fluidigm_data"

R script: 
R script can be found under the following folder: Data_analyses_in_R_Studio
This folder also contains the processed data files used in R-Studio, in the subfolder 'input_data'. These datafiles contain fold gene expression and p-value columns for either ileum or colon.
