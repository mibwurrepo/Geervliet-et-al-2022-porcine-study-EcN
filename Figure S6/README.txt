***General Introduction***
This README file corresponds to the data corresponding to Figure S6 of the manuscript.
This dataset contains data collected during an in vivo experiment with pigs at the Wageningen University as part of the PhD Thesis Projects of Mirelle Geervliet and Hugo de Vries (first authors of the manuscript). 
This research project was made possible by The Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research and Vereniging Diervoeders Nederland (VDN).

***Purpose of analysis***
To identify EcN-specific bacterial colonies in the Mesenteric Lymph Node (MLN) of pigs.

***Methodological information***
An EcN-specific colony PCR was carried out to investigate whether individual bacterial colonies on plates could be identified as being EcN.

***Data specific information***
In the Figure S6 folder, two subfoldors can be found, namely:

1. Unprocessed_Figure:
This folder contains the PDF file with the figure as generated by R. 
This PDF file was used to create Figure S6. 

2. Final_Figure:
This folder contains the final figure as presented in the manuscript. 
The final figure is prepared in Adoble Illustrator. 

Raw_data:
As this was a colony PCR, only visual and descriptive data was generated.

R script: 
Data from the colony PCR was not used for analyses in R-Studio.
