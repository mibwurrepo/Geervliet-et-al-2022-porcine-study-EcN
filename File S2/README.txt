Date of study: September until November 2018
Location of study: Swine Research Centre, St. Antonis, The Netherlands

***Purpose of the study***
We hypothesized that early life consumption of E. coli Nissle 1917 alters the porcine gut microbiota development (composition), the intestinal epithelial barrier and the immune system. 
In addition, we examined the temporal dynamics of these complex systems. A more developed and mature gut microbiota and immune system in early life could make the animals more resilient against invasive pathogens during the weaning phase and later in life.

***Description of the data in this dataset***
File S1 contains info regarding the primer pairs that were used for FLUIDIGM analyses. This file was especially shared to share gene targets, primer sequences, amplicon length, and primer efficiency.
